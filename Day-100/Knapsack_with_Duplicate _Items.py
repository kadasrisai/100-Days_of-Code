'''

Given a set of N items, each with a weight and a value, represented by the array w and val respectively. Also, a knapsack with weight limit W.
The task is to fill the knapsack in such a way that we can get the maximum profit. Return the maximum profit.
Note: Each item can be taken any number of times.

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 2
W = 3
val = {1, 1}
wt = {2, 1}
Output: 
3
Explanation: 
1.Pick the 2nd element thrice.
2.Total profit = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. Also the total weight = 1 + 1 + 1  = 3 which is <= 3.
Example 2:

Input: 
N = 4
W = 8
val[] = {6, 1, 7, 7}
wt[] = {1, 3, 4, 5}
Output: 
48
Explanation: 
The optimal choice is to pick the 1st element 8 times.'''


class Solution:
    def knapSack(self, N, W, val, wt):
        # code here
        dp=[0]*(W+1)
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(W+1):
                if j>=wt[i]:
                    dp[j]=max(dp[j],val[i]+dp[j-wt[i]])
        return dp[W]
