Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"
Output: false'''

    def isValid(self, s):

        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        stack = [] # create an empty stack to store opening brackets
        for c in s: # loop through each character in the string
            if c in '([{': # if the character is an opening bracket
                stack.append(c) # push it onto the stack
            else: # if the character is a closing bracket
                if not stack or \
                    (c == ')' and stack[-1] != '(') or \
                    (c == '}' and stack[-1] != '{') or \
                    (c == ']' and stack[-1] != '['):
                    return False # the string is not valid, so return false
                stack.pop() # otherwise, pop the opening bracket from the stack
        return not stack
